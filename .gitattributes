# ==== general rule ====
# Treat everything that looks like text as text; keep LF in the repo
* text=auto eol=lf

# ==== overrides ====
# Windows batch files need CRLF in the working tree 
*.bat   text eol=crlf

# PowerShell scripts can stay LF; modern PS handles it fine
*.ps1   text eol=lf

# Never touch binary assets
